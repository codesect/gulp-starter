<h1 align="center">ðŸ’¡ Gulp Starter Kit ðŸ’¡<br>for Front-End Projects</h1>

This Gulp starter kit will help you do front-end tasks like:

- combining HTML partials
- compiling ES6+ code, so you can use next-generation JavaScript
- compiling and auto prefixing your Sass files
- optimising your images, CSS, and JavaScript files
- spinning up a web server
- reloading the browser automatically whenever a file is saved
- synchronising interaction across multiple devices/browsers
- checking accessibility of production builds

## ðŸš€ Quick start

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/codesect/gulp-starter.git <your-project-name>
# Navigate into your new directory
cd <your-project-name>
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start dev server
npm start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`. Open the project in your code editor, and edit something in the `src` folder. Save your changes and the browser will update in real-time.

## What's Inside

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see inside.

    â”œâ”€â”€ dist
    â”œâ”€â”€ gulp
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ html

### `dist/`

This directory contains your compiled files. It will be created only after you run `npm start` or `npm run build`. This directory is not tracked by git and won't be uploaded to your repo.

### `gulp/`

This directory contains private gulp tasks used in `gulpfile.babel.js`.

### `node_modules/`

This directory contains all of the modules your project depends on. These are automatically installed when you run `npm install`.

### `src/`

This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site. This is the folder you're working in. If you want to rename it to something else, don't forget to update the `gulp/config.js` file.

### `.babelrc`

This is a configuration file for Babel. There is only one preset enabled by default, [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env). It only includes polyfills and code transforms needed for users whose browsers are defined in your `.browserlistrc` config.

### `.browserlistrc`

This is a configuration file used by Autoprefixer, Babel, and normalize.css to find your targeted browsers. [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) allows you to describe which browsers your site needs to support.

### `.eslintrc`

This is a configuration file for ESLint. ESLint is very flexible and configurable linter that helps to identify issues in your code.

### `.gitignore`

This file tells git which files it should not track.

### `.prettierrc`

This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

### `gulpfile.babel.js`

This file contains public tasks which can be run by the gulp command.

### `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

`package.json` is a manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. `package-lock.json` is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project.

### `README.md`

A text file containing information about your project. This is the one you're reading at the moment.

## Install and Build

Once you cloned the repo, you need to install the dependencies. You can use either `yarn` or `npm`:

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

### Start a dev server with browser-sync

It builds HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript bundle; starts a dev server and refreshes the browser on every saved change.

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

### Build production bundle

It uglifies JS, minifies CSS and images, replaces references to non-optimized scripts and stylesheets in HTML files and copies everything necessary to the `dist` folder - ready to upload.

```bash
npm run build
#Â OR
yarn build
```
